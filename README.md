# Used Car Price Prediction - Web Scraping & ML Exploration

This repository handles the data collection and initial machine learning experimentation for predicting used car prices using real-world data.

## What's Inside
- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for web scraping used car data from online sources.
- `ML project.ipynb`: Main notebook for data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and training regression models (e.g., ElasticNet, RandomForest).
- `output (1).csv`: Scraped and partially processed dataset.

## Project Goal
Collect authentic used car data via web scraping, perform feature engineering, and experiment with ML models to predict prices based on features like year, mileage, and engine type.

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup / requests / Selenium)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Itamar-Melnik/Project-web_scraping.git`
2. Install dependencies (if needed): `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests beautifulsoup4`
3. Open and run the notebooks in Jupyter.

## Status
