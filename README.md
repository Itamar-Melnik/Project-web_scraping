# Used Car Price Web Scraping & ML Exploration

This repository contains the data collection and machine learning experimentation part of a used car price prediction project.

## What's inside

- **`project.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook with web scraping logic to collect used car data from online sources.

- **`ML project.ipynb`**  
  Main notebook for data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and training/evaluating multiple regression models (including ElasticNet, RandomForest, etc.) to predict car prices.

- **`output (1).csv`**  
  The scraped and partially processed dataset used for model training.

## Project Goal

Collect real-world used car data via web scraping → prepare and analyze the data → experiment with machine learning models to predict vehicle prices based on features like year, mileage, engine type, etc.

## Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- Web scraping libraries (likely BeautifulSoup / requests / Selenium)
